A very basic to-do app which is made using Flask library (yeah no react lul)

# Want to run this application through your machine? Here are some mandatory things:
1. A Database (MongoDB more likely). This is needed to store all that to-dos there.
2. Package dependencies, paste this line in your terminal: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. At least some basic knowledge of the Flask framework. Or do you just want to grab the program without learning anything?
