A basic to-do application made using Flask with MongoDB

# Mandatory things to setup:
1. A MongoDB database. Store the data in your project folder doing `mkdir ./data/db`</br>
then setting the DB path. Run the database using `mongod --dbpath="./data/db"`.
2. Package dependencies, paste this line in your terminal: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. If everything is OK the final stage will be doing `python app.py` which runs the application in localhost.
